    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>There were kittens in the barn. And they were getting wet.</p>
    <p>The kittens were not happy. No, they were not happy at all.</p>
    <p>But this isn't a story about kittens or storms. I only brought up the storm and the kittens to create atmosphere. You've heard of atmosphere, haven't you?</p>
    <p>This a story about atmosphere. It was under pressure. This atmospheric pressure was starting to weigh the atmosphere down.</p>
